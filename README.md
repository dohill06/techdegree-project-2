# List Pagination and Filtering

View the demo https://dohill06.github.io/techdegree-project-2/

This project enhances the usability of a web page with pagination. This project uses "progressive enhancement" so that JavaScript is used to enhance the web page, without making the web page dependent upon JavaScript. The pagination is dynamic, meaning it will work for any list containing any number of items. This project was created for the purpose of the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree.
